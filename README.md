This project focuses on the implementation of various combinational circuits using the Verilog hardware description language. Combinational circuits are essential components in digital systems that perform operations solely based on the present input values, without any memory elements. By designing and simulating circuits such as the Look-Ahead Carry Generator, Ripple Carry Adder, BCD Adder, Decimal to BCD Encoder, and BCD Comparator, this project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in Verilog programming and deepen the understanding of these fundamental digital logic circuits.

Project Components:

Look-Ahead Carry Generator:

A Look-Ahead Carry Generator is implemented to accelerate the carry propagation in multi-bit addition circuits.
The Verilog code describes how to generate carry bits for each bit position in parallel, reducing propagation delays.
Ripple Carry Adder:

The Ripple Carry Adder is designed using Verilog, where each bit's sum and carry-out are calculated sequentially.
The implementation provides insights into the basic structure of an adder and its limitations due to sequential carry propagation.
BCD Adder:

The Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Adder adds two BCD numbers using Verilog.
BCD is a common numeric representation where each decimal digit is encoded using four binary bits.
The project illustrates how to handle BCD arithmetic and handle digit carry-out.
Decimal to BCD Encoder:

Decimal to BCD encoding is implemented in Verilog.
This circuit converts a decimal number into its corresponding BCD representation.
The encoding process is broken down into a series of logic operations.
BCD Comparator:

The BCD Comparator is designed using Verilog to compare two BCD numbers.
The project demonstrates how to compare BCD digits and handle the borrow-out signal.
Learning Objectives:

Gain hands-on experience in Verilog programming for digital logic circuits.
Understand the concept of carry propagation and how it impacts adder performance.
Explore the implementation of arithmetic circuits, such as BCD addition and comparison.
Learn about BCD encoding and how it relates to binary-to-decimal conversion
